# Bible.json

This uses USFM files of the World English Bible as of 2025-02-01, converts them to JSON (`main.ts`) and then can collapse them into a single array of verses (`collapse.ts`).

## Output Format of bible.json

The JSON file includes the deuterocanonical books. It is formatted like so:

```json
[
    {
        "book": "Genesis",
        "chapters": [
            [ // chapter 1
                {
                    "book": "Genesis",
                    "chapter": 1,
                    "verse": 1,
                    "text": "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.  \n"
                },
                {
                    "book": "Genesis",
                    "chapter": 1,
                    "verse": 2,
                    "text": "The earth was formless and empty. Darkness was on the surface of the deep and God's Spirit was hovering over the surface of the waters.   \n"
                }
                // ...
            ],
            [
                {
                    "book": "Genesis",
                    "chapter": 2,
                    "verse": 1,
                    "text": "The heavens, the earth, and all their vast array were finished.  \n"
                }
                // ...
            ]
            // ...
        ]
    },
    {
        "book": "Exodus",
        "chapters": [
            [
                // chapter 1
            ],
            [
                // chapter 2
            ]
            // ...
        ]
    }
]
```


## Reconstruction

I used Deno to run the scripts. To reconstruct the `bible.json` file, run the following commands:

```bash
deno run --allow-read=. --allow-write=. main.ts
deno run --allow-read=. --allow-write=. collapse.ts
```

Now you have a `bible.json` file that you can use to do whatever you want.
